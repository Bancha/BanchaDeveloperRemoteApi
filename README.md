API-Viewer for JS Developers
=============================

This Add-On for Bancha helps Developer-Teams in the process of creating Bancha Applications. JavaScript Frontend Developers no longer have to dig through any PHP code to find the available remote methods.

Instead they just open _/developer-remote-api.html_ in debug mode in their browser and can view all remotely available CakePHP Controller methods.

### Features:

 - Dynamically reflects on CakePHP app
 - Displays searchable RemoteStubs
 - Uses both Reflection and PHPDoc comments
 - Supports code tags and MarkDown syntax
